2) People purchase through Freshla and pay shipping directly to us. You can have shipping restrictions like allowing people to choose ground or requiring 2 day per-product.<br>
3) We email the order including shipping costs. These will be reimbursed to you when we consolidate payments every month.<br>
4) Freshla direct deposits your receipts monthly, less a commission of 20% from each sale, plus a 50cents/transaction fee.<br>
